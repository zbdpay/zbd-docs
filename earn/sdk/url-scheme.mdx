To enable the ZBD app to redirect back to your game after the user connects via the ZBD app,we need to know your game's URL scheme.
If you’ve already set this up, please share it with your ZBD contact.
If this is your first time setting it up, don’t worry. The process is straightforward for both iOS and Android.

## In Unity:


<Steps>
    <Step title="Select the ZBDSDK Prefab in your Hierarchy">
    </Step>
    <Step title="In the Inspector, locate the ZBD Controller script.">
    </Step>
    <Step title="Find the URL Scheme input field.">
    </Step>
    <Step title="Enter your custom URL scheme (for example: sdkdemo).">
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
    If you’ve already added the custom URL scheme to your Android Manifest (AndroidManifest.xml) or iOS plist file, leave the field empty.

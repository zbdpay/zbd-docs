It’s important to explain the security assumptions of the SDK and to reiterate that no game is 100% secure—especially when real-money rewards are involved.

If you do not call the **`SendReward`** endpoint from your own backend server, it must be called from the client, which exposes it to abuse. A malicious attacker could potentially call this endpoint multiple times to reward themselves the maximum amount of Bitcoin.

To mitigate this, **we limit how much a user can withdraw based on how long their device has been online.**

<Info>
For example, a user may attempt to reward themselves 10,000 sats, but they will only be able to withdraw 2 sats per 5 minutes of "Time Alive", effectively slowing down withdrawals to prevent farming.

# Time Alive

When your app/game is open, the SDK sends a “ping” to the ZBD backend roughly every 20 seconds. This allows the SDK to calculate how long it has been online in a way that cannot be easily spoofed.

Additionally, we use Apple and Google attestation systems to verify that the device is genuine and is running a non-rooted and non-jailbroken OS.

This further restricts malicious users, as they are only able to withdraw a maximum of **X sats every Y minutes per Z real devices**.

However, a more sophisticated operation may involve hundreds of genuine devices kept online in an attempt to farm rewards while passing attestation checks.

To help mitigate this, we can toggle additional verification steps such as CAPTCHAs or facial recognition at the point of withdrawal. We also monitor network and IP address activity —- but none of these measures are foolproof. A determined attacker may still find ways to bypass them.

This is why we **strongly recommend (almost require) calling the `SendReward` method from your own secure backend servers** and providing us with the IP address of that server, so we can restrict access to only trusted sources.

# Attestation

In order to make sure we have everything we need to detect your app/game has not been tampered with as part of our attestation check, we require a couple of pieces of information.

### Android

For Android we need your Bundle ID or package name i.e. `com.domain.appname` -- this is what you set in your Unity build settings.

We also need the SHA256 hash of your app signing key.

To find your app's SHA256 hash key for Google Play:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the Google Play Console and select your app">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to 'Release'">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on 'Setup'">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to 'App Integrity'">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select 'App Signing'">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the SHA256 hash key">
    Find the `App signing key certificate` section and copy the SHA-256 fingerprint.
  </Step>
</Steps>

For development purposes you can generate a SHA256 hash key for your keystore using the following command:

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore path/to/your.keystore -alias your_alias -storepass your_keystore_password -keypass your_key
```

It should look something like this

```bash
EA:A1:69:AA:2F:FC:6D:16:84:ED:06:11:E0:65:2B:E0:BB:9C:5B:E3:41:96:06:E2:3D:85:8F:2C:22:2A:E9:86
```

### iOS

For iOS we need your Bundle ID (`com.domain.appname`) and your Team ID.

To find your app's Team ID:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the Apple Developer Portal">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to 'Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles'">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select 'Identifiers'">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your app">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the Team ID">
    Copy the code from the `Team ID` section.
  </Step>
</Steps>

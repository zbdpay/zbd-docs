Withdrawal limits control the maximum amount a user can withdraw from their rewards balance at any time. You can use either of these methods:

- **Retrieve via SDK** - Check a user's current limit using the GetBalance method
- **Manage via REST API** - Increase or decrease withdrawal limits through dedicated API endpoints

---

## Retrieving Withdrawal Limit via SDK

The easiest way to get a user's withdrawal limit is through the `GetBalance` SDK method. The withdrawal limit is included in the callback response.

### Implementation

Call `GetBalance` to retrieve the user's current withdrawal limit:

```csharp
ZBDController.Instance.GetBalance(callback =>
{
  if (callback.success)
  {
    // Get the user's withdrawal limit in satoshis (not millisatoshis)
    long withdrawalLimitSats = callback.withdrawalLimit;
    Debug.Log($"Withdrawal limit: {withdrawalLimitSats} sats");
  }
  else
  {
    Debug.LogError($"GetBalance failed: {callback.message}");
  }
});
```

## Managing Withdrawal Limits via REST API

You can use these endpoints to increase or decrease a user's withdrawal limit. Admin JWT authentication is required.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Increase Withdrawal Limit" icon="arrow-up" href="/earn/sdk/increase-withdrawal-limit">
    Raise a user's withdrawal limit with the REST API
  </Card>
  <Card title="Decrease Withdrawal Limit" icon="arrow-down" href="/earn/sdk/decrease-withdrawal-limit">
    Lower a user's withdrawal limit with the REST API
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

With these two methods available, you can choose the one that best fits your application use the SDK for client-side integration or the REST API for server-side management.

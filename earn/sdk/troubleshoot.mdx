# Build Issues

- If you encounter build issues, it is important to check that the Android and iOS deployment targets and minimum API level are set properly. Refer to [Compatibility](/rewards/sdk/compatibility) for more information.

- If you receive a sign up error, please confirm that your Bundle ID / Package Name is the same as the one used whilst setting up the SDK configuration.

- Make sure the stripping level is set to low or minimum in the Unity build settings.

If you get the following build errors on Android please check the **[Building for Android](/rewards/sdk/building#building-for-android)** section.

# Performance Issues

The ZBD Rewards SDK forces hardware acceleration in Android builds, this can cause some issues with games.

If you notice performance issues after integrating the ZBD Rewards SDK you can delete the `ModifyUnityAndroidAppManifestSample.cs` file in the `Assets/Editor/` folder.

# Unity Input Settings Issues

To ensure maximum compatibility when working with the ZBD Rewards SDK, it is recommended to adjust Unity’s input configuration.
The Unity Editor’s WebView may influence how input is handled, so setting **Active Input Handling** to **Both** helps maintain consistent support across the Old Input Manager and the New Input System.

The ZBD Earn API allows developers to send in-game or app-based rewards to users securely.  
By default, rewards can be issued from **both the client SDK** and your **backend server**.

For stronger security and better control, you can restrict reward sending so that **only your backend** can issue rewards.  
This setup uses the **API version blocklist** feature for your Rewards App.

<Note>
    Server-only reward sending is recommended when:
    - You perform additional gameplay or business validation before issuing rewards
    - Your app offers higher-value rewards or gift card redemptions
    - You want to minimize client-side abuse and enforce strict control
</Note>

## Rate Limiting

The server-side endpoints are rate-limited to **60 requests per second**.

If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic to handle rate limiting gracefully.


## How It Works

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create an API Key for Your Rewards App (Server Authentication)">
        Generate a dedicated API key to authenticate your backend with the ZBD Earn API.
    </Step>
    

    <Step title="Restrict Client-Side Reward Sending">
        Use the API version blocklist to disable client-side reward calls, ensuring only your server can issue rewards.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Send a Reward from Your Backend Using the v2 API">
        Use your backend to issue rewards securely through the v2 API endpoint.
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Manage Blocklist Entries (List or Delete)">
        If client restrictions are enabled, you can view or remove entries from your API version blocklist.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Manage API Keys (List or Revoke)">
        Maintain your API keys by listing or revoking them as needed for security.
    </Step>
</Steps>



Next, let’s begin with **creating your API key**, which authenticates your backend for sending rewards.

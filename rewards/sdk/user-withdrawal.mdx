Withdrawal limits control the maximum amount a user can withdraw from their rewards balance. You can retrieve current limits using the SDK and manage them programmatically via our REST API.

## Retrieving Withdrawal Limit (SDK)

You can check the withdrawal limit of a user from the `GetBalance` response by checking `callback.withdrawalLimit`.

```csharp
ZBDController.Instance.GetBalance(callback=>
{
  if (callback.success)
  {
    // the users withdrawal limit in satoshis (not millisatoshis)
    Debug.Log(callback.withdrawalLimit);
  }
  else
  {
    Debug.LogError("get balance error " + callback.message);
  }
});
```

## Managing Withdrawal Limits via API

Need to programmatically adjust withdrawal limits for your users? Use our REST API endpoints to increase or decrease limits:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Increase Withdrawal Limit" icon="arrow-up" href="/rewards/sdk/increase-withdrawal-limit">
    Raise a user's withdrawal limit with the REST API
  </Card>
  <Card title="Decrease Withdrawal Limit" icon="arrow-down" href="/rewards/sdk/decrease-withdrawal-limit">
    Lower a user's withdrawal limit with the REST API
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These endpoints require admin JWT authentication and support both MSATS and POINT currencies.

# Reward Unit

In the ZBD Rewards SDK, rewards are sent as **units**. A **unit** is a **configurable value** determined by your ZBD Customer Success Manager and can represent different amounts, such as **1 satoshi** or **\$0.10**.

For example, if the game is configured so that **1 unit = 1 satoshi**, sending 1 reward will send 1 satoshi. Conversely, if the game is set up so that **1 unit = \$0.10**, sending 1 reward will send the equivalent of \$0.10 in satoshis.

**Your games config** could also be set up so that **a unit would represent a point in your game**, e.g. sending **1 unit** would send **1 "Gem"** which is worth **$0.10**.


# Sending Rewards

To send a reward to a user you can call:

```csharp
ZBDController.Instance.SendReward(1, callback =>
{
  if (callback.success)
  {
    // reward sent
  }
  else
  {
    Debug.LogError("send reward error " + callback.message);
  }
});
```

<Note>
    For enhanced security and validation, we recommend handling reward distribution from your backend server.

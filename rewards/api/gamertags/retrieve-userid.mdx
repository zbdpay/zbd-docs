title: "Get UserID by Gamertag"
description: "Convert a ZBD Gamertag to a permanent User ID for reliable tracking"
api: "GET https://api.zbdpay.com/v0/user-id/gamertag/{GAMERTAG}"
---

Get a user's permanent ID from their ZBD Gamertag. Essential for tracking users reliably since gamertags can change but User IDs never do.

<Warning>
  **Critical for User Tracking** - Gamertags are like Twitter handles - users can change them anytime. Always use the permanent User ID for databases, limits, and historical tracking.
</Warning>
